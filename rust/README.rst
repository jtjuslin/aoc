Advent of Code, Rust edition
============================

2023 I finally got myself around to code some Rust taking part in Advent of Code.

Here's some random notes:

* Day 5 part 2 is really heavy to run. I'm probably missing something.
* Do some additional tests to explore that front
* Extract stuff to libraries shared by parts 1 and 2
* .iter() vs .into_inter() what the heck? .collect()?
* Read about usize, and about primitives in general.
* Setup debugging
